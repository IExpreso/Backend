## Installation
Make sure you have a node version supporting ecmascript 6 (6.11.3 recommended), and npm.
In the root directory:
```bash
$ npm install
```

You also need mysql and an account with a password (tested with mysql-server version 5.7).
```bash
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
```

once done that, enter to mysql cli and execute the config/create_db.sql script to
create the databases, tables and populate them. If you run the script again it will
wipe the existing data and create everything again.

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p'root_password_here'
mysql> source config/create_db.sql
```

Now with `npm start` the server should start in port 3000.
